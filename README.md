# AutoDRIVE Simulator: Palmetto Cluster Deployments

This branch hosts resources for deployments of the AutoDRIVE Simulator on Palmetto 2 HPC cluster.

## Submit Job to Palmetto 2 HPC Cluster

The overall project objective focuses on variability testing of the AEB functionality (SUT) for OpenCAV. Each test is stored in its own sub-folder, under the [`palmetto`](palmetto) directory. In order to reproduce any one of these tests, you will need to upload the corresponding sub-folder to your Palmetto 2 `home` folder, update the relevant paths within each script, and then submit the corresponding job script via Palmetto 2's `QSUB` scheduler:
```bash
qsub autodrive_test.sh
```
## Create `conda` Environment 

All tests also rely on the **`autodrive`** conda environment being available to you on Palmetto 2. This environment can be recreated, as needed, from the file [`palmetto/environment.yml`](palmetto/environment.yml), using the following command:
```bash
conda env create -n autodrive -f environment.yml
```

## Build AutoDRIVE Simulator Image

It is assumed that you have an installation of the required version of AutoDRIVE Simulator. Please refer to the instructions below to set up a containerized installation of AutoDRIVE Simulator by use of a sandboxed Singularity container. In order to perform the build process, you first need to procure a Docker image for AutoDRIVE Simulator. This image can either be built using the instructions provided in this same repository, under the [**`docker`**](https://github.com/AutoDRIVE-Ecosystem/AutoDRIVE-Simulator-HPC/tree/docker) branch, or the [**`autodriveecosystem/autodrive_sim_opencav`**](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/autodriveecosystem/autodrive_sim_opencav) pre-built image available on Docker Hub may be pulled and used instead.

You may build a Singularity sandbox for it under your Palmetto 2 `home` folder using the following command:
```bash
cd ~
singularity build --sandbox autodrive_simulator/ docker://autodriveecosystem/autodrive_sim_opencav
```

## Start Instance of the Sandbox

Once the image is built and written to the destination, start the instance of the sandbox using the following command:
```bash
singularity instance start --nv -B $HOME,$TMPDIR autodrive_simulator/ inst1
```

## Run Instance of the Sandbox

Run the started instance of the sandbox using the following command (the `writable` flag allows us to make changes within the container should we need to save these changes as images):
```bash
singularity run --writable --nv -B $HOME,$TMPDIR instance://inst1
```
